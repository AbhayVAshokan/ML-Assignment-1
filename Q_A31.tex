\textcolor{ReddishRose} {Bagging} \\{ Building multiple models, typically of the same type from different subsamples of the training dataset. 

\textcolor{ReddishRose} {Boosting} \\ Building multiple models, typically of the same type each of which learns to fix the prediction errors of a prior model in the chain.

\textcolor{ReddishRose} {Voting} \\Building multiple models, typically of differing types and simple statistics like calculating the mean are used to combine predictions.}
