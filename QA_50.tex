\subsubsection*{\textcolor{purple}{Definitions}}
A number of Machine Learning Algorithms - Supervised or Unsupervised, use Distance Metrics to know the input data pattern in order to make any Data Based decision. A good distance metric helps in improving the performance of Classification, Clustering and Information Retrieval process significantly.Euclidian distance and manhattan distance are two distance metrics used in machine learning algorithms for classification.

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{purple}{Formulas}}
distance calculation  between two points A(p1,p2) and B(q1,q2) 

i)Euclidian distance
\[       D_e=(\sum_{i=1}^{n}(p_i-q_i)^2)^{1/2}\]

ii)Manhattan distance
        \[D_m=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mid{p_i-q_i}\mid\]

where n is the no. of dimensions

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{purple}{Answer}}
 By question n=3 and x1(2,3,4) x2(4,3,5)
 \\(a)Euclidian distance
  \[D_e=(\sum_{i=1}^{3}(p_i-q_i)^2)^{1/2}\]
  \[=((2-4)^2+(3-3)^2+(4-5)^2)^{1/2}\]
  \[=(4+0+1)^{1/2}\]
  \[=5^{1/2}\]
  \[=2.23\]
\\(b)Manhattan Distance
\[D_m=\sum_{i=1}^{3}\mid{p_i-q_i}\mid
\[=\mid(2-4)\mid+\mid(3-3)\mid+\mid(4-5)\mid\]
\[=2+0+1\]
\[=3\]
