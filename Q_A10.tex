\textbf{\textcolor{LightMagenta}{Consider two data points in two dimensional A(5,8) and B(8,9).Calculate 
(a) City block distance (b) Chessboard distance between A \& B. (December 2018 - Q10) \hfill 4 marks}} \\[5pt]


a.City block distance is given by,\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left|x_{ik}-x{jk}\right| \] 

 \[d_{ba}=  \left|5-8\right|  +  \left|8-9\right| \] 

 therefore  \[ d_{ba}=3+1=4 \]

Therefore City block distance is 4
\vspace{0.5cm}

b.Chessboard distance between A and B is given by  \[ \max (\left|x_2-x_1 \right| , \left|y_2-y_1 \right|) \]

\[\max(\left|5-8 \right| ,\left|8-9\right|) \]
\[\max({3,1}) =3 \]

Therefore Chessboard distance is 3
