\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    \textcolor{purple} {Hypothesis space} \\
    Hypothesis space is the set of all the possible legal hypothesis. This is the set from which the machine learning algorithm would determine the best possible (only one) which would best describe the target function or the outputs.\newline
    
    \item 
    \textcolor{purple} {Version space} \\ 
    Any h element of H between S and G is a valid hypothesis with no error and is said to be consistent with the training set, and such h make up the version space. The version space, V SH,D, with respect to hypothesis space subset of hypotheses from H consistent with all training examples in D.
    \newline
    
    \item
    \textcolor{purple} {Most Generalhypothesis} \\ 
    General Hypothesis is the largest rectangle we can draw that includes all the positive examples and none of the negative examples.
    
    \item
    \textcolor{purple} {Specific hypothesis} \\
    {Specific Hypothesis is the tightest rectangles that includes all the possible examples and none of the negative examples.\newline
    Hypothesis h=S as the induced cl }
